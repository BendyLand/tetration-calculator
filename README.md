# Tetration Calculator

A calculator to handle tetration, written in C!

## About

I think the concept of tetration is really neat. That's the whole motivation for this project. I know it won't be practical in the slightest.

If you don't know what tetration is, it is essentially just iterated exponents. 

**For example:**

^4^2 (or 2↑↑4) == 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 == 2 ^ 2 ^ 4 == 2 ^ 16 == 65_536

^4^3 (or 3↑↑4) == 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 == 3 ^ 3 ^ 27 == 3 ^ 7_625_597_484_987 == ...a *really* big number (like multiple trillions of digits).

As I mentioned before, these numbers are so stupidly large that there is basically no practical use for them unless you want to do something like convert light years to feet for some reason. 

I still think it'll be a fun project to try. If nothing else, it'll test my problem solving.
